    <h2>I Want Better is that "easier" enablement. It's a new way to deal with the abortion topic.</h2>

    <p><span class="bold">Instead of one side or the other, I Want Better enables you to stand for what you believe
            in, <span class="highlight">even next to others whose beliefs are not exact to yours.</span></span> {{ twitter('Nobody really likes abortion, to be for something better should be a lot easier than it is. I Want Better makes it easier. #goodforall', '#goodforall') }}
    </p>

    <p>These three words (I Want Better) take a difficult topic usually navigated by people groups - 
        religion, race, politics, etc. - to a stripped down individualized version. The realization that only I can give
        myself better is hugely needed in the current rut of thinking. <span class="highligh">No government, no church and no law can give me better</span> or 
        anyone else ultimately. In the formation of sides we are spending our time and efforts working against each other.
        The information here works to erase sides and introduce the enablement of individual application with the hopeful idea
        that it becomes contagious.
    </p>

    <p><span class="highlights">The statement I Want Better is meant to be the residual response to the question “What is 
            your stance on abortion?”</span> It does a few revolutionary alterations to this societal dead topic,
        <span class="highlight">while taking its user to the heart of the matter, plus providing progressive propellment.</span> 
    </p>

    <h2>The Official Icon of the I Want Better 
        campaign is the greater-than symbol (>). </h2>

    <p>This mark was chosen to represent this cause because of its origin and the disposition it
        conveyed. It was found in the topic itself: Abortion. <span class="highlight">Turning the capital A on it’s side</span> posed a 
        powerful question (What is better than abortion) and created <span class="highlight">a beautiful empty space</span> that 
        was <span class="highlight">inviting to the user.</span> This is an altogether different disposition than what we currently 
        possess and a different campaign functionality to that which we find in prochoice and prolife. 
        It’s not based on group use and instead of a campaign that tries to provide the answer, it 
        <span class="highlight">simply provides the question</span> and <span class="highlight">goes on to accept the fact that there are many answers 
                needed to truly solve this issue.</span>

    <h2>Abortion Sucks &amp; So Does Government Control.</h2>

    <p>This may be a bit of a juvenile statement yet <span class="highlight">iconic</span> in the least and most of all - <span class="highlight">side 
            transcending.</span> It instantly says I am on neither side. It’s deep if you let it sink in and if not, it’s 
        still very catchy. {{ twitter('Abortion sucks! And so does goverment control. #fresh #iwantbetter', '#fresh') }}
    </p>

    <p>So, is this "prochoice" or "prolife"?</p>

    <h2>I want nothing to do with pro choice vs pro 
        life,<sup>*</sup> but I do believe <span class="bold">we</span> - the human race - 
        <span class="bold">can do better than abortion. </span>
        <sup>*</sup>or vice versa.
    </h2>

    <p>In most cases if the topic of abortion is being spoken of these terms are involved. This blurb 
        wants to make very clear that <span class="highlight">this campaign is not about either of these terms</span>, but about the 
        superlative pursuit of better - a very subjective term, yes. The user should be free to use it 
        personally. {{ twitter('I want nothing to do with prolife vs prochoice, but I do believe we the human race can do better than abortion. #iwantbetter', '#notprolife #notprochoice #iwantbetter') }}
    </p>

    <p>The asterisk is there to convey that this blurb is not meant to pick on either of those 
        campaigns in particular. These simple critiques are meant for one thing - timely liberation.
    </p>

    <h2>It’s a problem that the word abortion only 
        exists in the context of debate.
    </h2>

    <p>Why do we see such love, creativity,  and progressive thinking applied to other human issues, 
        but not to this one? It’s a problem I Want Better aims to solve, first by empowering the 
        individual then by finding our common ground, hence the next blurb -
    </p>

    <h2>Yet inarguably - <span class="bold">WE CAN DO BETTER.</span></h2>

    <p>We probably will never all see eye to eye, but there are commonalities we can embrace and 
        there is a common ground on which we can meet. What is better? It’s going to be different to 
        every user but here is a basic beginning list -

        <img class="share-title pin-share-title" src="{{ asset('img/pin-text.svg') }}">
    </div>

    <h2>MEDICINE is Better. ADOPTION is Better.
    PEOPLE are Better. CHOICE is Better.</h2>

    <p>The examples here <span class="highlight">ambiguously break the mold of both categorical sides</span> in a thought 
        provoking, artful and inspirational way. <span class="highlight">The topic needs such thrust, such allowance.</span> These 
        public service announcements help. {{ twitter('Medicine is better. Adoption is better. Choice is better. People are better. #abortion #iwantbetter ', '#abortion') }}
    </p>

    <h2>Prolife vs Prochoice should not be the 
    only way for us to deal w/the abortion 
    topic.</h2>

    <p>They’re simply not engineered for the vast majority of public use. We need something that it 
        is. <span class="highlight">I Want Better aims to be that.</span> Even though 7 billion humans pursuing what they each 
        define as better might seem problematic, it is a much improved atmosphere for us to apply 
        our efforts to this cause. <span class="highlight">The purposeful subjectivity</span> and <span class="highlight">abstractness of this campaign is 
                meant to bring a paradigm shift that allows all of us, as differing as we may be, to be part of a 
                bigger whole without disabling logistics.</span> {{ twitter('Prochoice vs Prolife should not be the only way for us to deal with the #abortion topic so #iwantbetter was made.', '#7Billion') }}

    <h2>A Common Goal - <span class="bold">LET’S SOLVE OUR 
            NEED FOR ABORTION.</span> Ps. Outlawing is 
        Not Solving.
    </h2>

    <p>The realization of an achievable goal would be a very empowering shift from where we are
        now. Are you either an advocate of a practice that simply is not our best or are you for the 
        increase of government control? Neither of these are our best. Of all the amazing things we 
        have done together as the human race - exploration of the entire earth including the depths 
        of the sea and outer space, the combustion engine, jet propulsion, news plus instant 
        connection to the whole world at the touch of a finger /24 hours a day, cures for age old 
        diseases, racial and gender equality - <span class="highlight">we should just be able to do better than abortion</span>. I 
        Want Better is a call to the innate innovative spirit of mankind to create real solution to this 
        topic and build a better tomorrow. {{ twitter('Let\'s solve our need for abortion. Ps. Outlawing is not solving. #humanscan #iwantbetter', '#HumansCan') }}
    </p>

    <h2>PREVENTION is Better. SCIENCE is Better.
    TECHNOLOGY is Better.</h2>

    <p>Here the ongoing list of what is better continues. It is important to understand the I Want 
        Better campaign is not the only purveyor of such information, the individual user provides 
        the answers. The campaign does not supply a guide to the correctness or validity of use, the 
        user is free to decide that themselves. Even if one user looks at another users answer as 
        absurd, incorrect or ineffective - <span class="highlight">I Want Better sees an increased user base as progression</span> 
        and a better place for us to be. You can hardly even talk about this topic in current society 
        productively. That is sad.
    </p>

    <h2>ALTERNATIVES are Better. LIFE is Better. 
    WE are Better.</h2>

    <p>The list of what is better is not ruled by extremists or their viewpoints, but instead it calls to 
        all humanity. <span class="highlight">It implores us to reach for better, to be our best</span>. Hence, the <span class="highlight">Official Color</span> of this 
        campaign is <span class="highlight">Metallic Gold</span> (and other forms of yellow). <span class="highlight">Gold is a reminder in a universal 
                language to be the best we can be. Go for Gold.</span> {{ twitter('I Want Better calls to all humanity. #goforgold #iwantbetter', '#goforgold') }}

    <h2><span class="bold">INSPIRE CHANGE</span><br>It’s a More Worthy Cause than Legislating it</h2>

{{-- </div> --}}

{{--@include('grid')--}}

{{-- <div class="paragraph-section"> --}}
    <p>Real change may not ever come from any other source. It’s been told to us throughout the 
        years that if you want change start with yourself. Do! You’re worth it. Others may watch and  
        learn while seeing new possibilities attainable. All by the simple, personal pursuit of 
        individuals wanting better. This can achieve more than a rulebook or law ever could.
    </p>

    <h2>CREATIVITY <span class="bold">></span><br>
        INNOVATION <span class="bold">></span><br>
        YOU <span class="bold">></span></h2>

    <p><span class="highlight">Our history suggests that our conduct toward abortion has not been our best. The subjects 
            here, plus many others are being called out. A lot of developments need to occur, I Want 
            Better hopes to be the basis for such.</span>
    </p>

    <h2><span class="regular">THIS CAMPAIGN EXISTS TO BE</span>:
    The Structure &amp; Stability of the World’s 
    Efforts as we Work Step by Step in Solving 
    Our Need for Abortion.</h2>

    <p>The very simplistic mentality contained in the three words I Want Better, facilitates the ability 
        for us, even in all our differences, to be together under a basic campaign. <span class="highlight">Starting first and 
                foremost with self and perhaps self only.</span> I Want Better allows any level of commitment from 
        it’s user. The abortion topic needs such freedom of use. {{ twitter('Look what I found! A new way to deal with the abortion topic. #finally #iwantbetter', '#finally') }}
    </p>

    <h2><span class="regular">THIS IS A CAUSE</span>, NOT A DEBATE.</h2>

    <p>There is a foaming at the mouth by some users when engaged with this topic. It is important 
        to understand <span class="highlight">this cause needs our love, our creativity and if at all possible our togetherness.</span> 
        This is a cause, not a war against each other. {{ twitter('This cause needs our love, creativity and if at all possible our togetherness. This is a cause, not a war against each other. #iwantbetter', '#causenotdebate') }} 
    </p>

    <h2>THIS IS <span class="regular">NOT RELIGION.</span></h2>

    <p>You do not have to be religious to be a part of or to use the I want Better campaign. Wanting 
        better and or believing humanity is capable of more does not come with the mandate to 
        belong to any religion. <span class="highlight">Whatever you call yourself, whoever you are - I Want Better is for you.</span> 
        Want better anyway you see fit and I will do the same, hopefully there will be 7 billion other 
        users. That is change. {{ twitter('This is not religion. #iLike #iwantbetter', '#iLikeIWantBetter') }} 
    </p>

    <h2>THIS IS <span class="bold">NOT POLITICS.</span> THIS IS FOR YOU.</h2>

    <p>This cause is <span class="highlight">so wrongfully handicapped by the side vs side disposition</span> of world politics, it is 
        very important to break free of this. Allowing users the ability to deal with this topic in an 
        effective and productive manner will <span class="highlight">urge on a thriving of solutionable steps.</span>  {{ twitter('This is not politics. This is for you. #userfriendly #iwantbetter', '#userfriendly') }}

    <h2>I Want Better - mainly because that is all I 
        have real control of, myself. </h2>
