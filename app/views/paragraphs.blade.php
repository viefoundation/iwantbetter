    <h2>Hello,<br>Below you will find a written commentary to the video you just watched above. Enjoy.</h2>

    <p>The statement I want Better<sup>1</sup> does a few revolutionary alterations to the societal
        dead topic: abortion; delivering it's user at the heart of the matter + the provision of progressive propellment.
        <sup>1-</sup> Residual response to "What is your stance on abortion?"
    </p>

    <p>The realization that only I fcan give myself better than abortion is hugely needed in the current rut of thinking.
        No government, no church, no law, etc. can give me or anyone else better; ultimately. It really comes down to the individual.
        In the formation of sides we are spending our time in working against other, the information you'll find here erases sides introducing
        individual pursuit &amp; the hopeful idea that that will inspire others to do the same.
    </p>

    <p>Inspiring change / enabling change is the road to better. Legislation, policy, guilt, emotional ploy, hate &amp;
        animosity will not give it to us. #inspirechange
    </p>

    <h2>Abortion Sucks &amp; So Does Government Control.</h2>
    
    <p>A bit juvenile a statement yet iconic in the least &amp; most of all instantly side transcending,
        an of the topics' current condition. It instantly says I am on neither side. It's deep if you
        let it sink in &amp; if you don't it's still very catchy. One the one hand you have a seemingly
        "prolife" statement then it's trumped by what seems to be a "prochoice" blurb. These terms are in quotation because
        their meanings are not of face value nor the definitions semantically true - in societal form they are not used in 
        theur pure definition form.
    </p>

    <h2>I want nothing to do with pro choice vs pro life<sup>*</sup>, but I do believe <span class="bold">we</span> - the human race - <span class="bold">can do better than abortion</span>.<sup>*</sup>or vice versa</h2>

    <p>In most cases if the topic of abortion is being spoke of these terms are most likely involved, HOWEVER this
        blurb wants to make it very clear this campaign is not about neither of these but about the superlative pursuit
        of better... a very subjective term yes - the user should be free to use it personally. 
    </p>

    <p>Why the asterisk, to convey that this blurb is not meant to pick on either of the current campaigns in particular.
        Please don't take critiques contained personally, see them for what they are meant to be - timely liberations to say the least.
    </p>

    <h2>It's a problem that the word abortion only exists in the context of debate.</h2>

    <p>Why do we see such love &amp; creativity, ingenuity, progression being applied to other human issues,
        but not here? It's a problem as stated and IWBc wants it solved. The home the re-engineering of the topic
        as purveyed through the I Want Better Campaign will change the polarizing extremism in debate 7 hate. #humanissue</p>

    <h2>Yet Inarguably - <span class="bold">WE CAN DO BETTER</span></h2>

    <p>We may never see eye to eye as the human race but there are commonalities we can embrace / there is a common ground we can meet on.</p>

    <h2>MEDICINE is Better. ADOPTION is Better. PEOPLE are Better. CHOICE is Better.</h2>

    <p>The list here &amp; hereafter of what is better ambiguously breaks the molds of both categorical 
        sides in a thought provoking, artful &amp; inspirational way. The topic needs such thrust, such
        allowance. These PSA statements help.
    </p>

    <h2>ProLife vs ProChoice<sup>*</sup> should not be the only way for us to deal w/the abortion topic. <sup>*</sup>and vice versa.</h2>

    <p>7 Billion humans pursuing what they each define as better is a while lot better an atmosphere for us to
        apply our efforts to a colective cause. The purposeful, subjectivity &amp;
        abstractness of this campaign isn;t aimed to bring about any one people groups' objective or idealogical end.
        It is meant to bring a paradigm shift that allows &amp; enables all of us as differing as we may be to apply ourselves
        &amp; be part perhaps of a bigger while without the disabling logistical / cookie-cutter correctness. #callingonall7billion</p>

    <h2>A Common Goal - <span class="bold">LET'S SOLVE OUR NEED FOR ABORTION.</span> Ps. Outlawing is Not Solving.</h2>

    <p>The realization of an achievable goal would be a very empowering shift from where we are now
        having to be either an advocate of a practive that simply is not our best or be for the
        increase of giving another control of seld. Of all the amazing things we have done together as the
        human race - outer space, exploration of the entire earth including the depths of the sea, combustion engine,
        jet propulsion, news + instant connection to the world at the touch of a finger 24 hours a day, cures for age old diseases, 
        racial &amp; gender equality - we should just be able to do better than abortion. IWBc is a calal to the innovative,
        innate spirit of mankind to invest today in a better tomorrow &amp; create real solution to this topic. The fact is
        very few of us want to hurt small things (let alone "kill babies"), go through the inconvenience of the
        abortion process, hate, debate, enable government with more control or mistreat women. it shouldn't have to be one thing or another.
        To have to be extreme or consistent with all the excessive ciews &amp; opinions of a religious or political side to not be
        "pro-abortion", there must be something better.</p>

    <h2>ALTERNATIVES are Better. LIFE is Better. WE are Better.</h2>

    <p>The list of what is better is not ruled by extremism or it’s viewpoints, but instead call to all 
        humanity to implore us<sup>*</sup> reaching for better / to be our<sup>*</sup> best. <sup>*</sup>Sometimes in a collective 
        form as listed in this sentence, but mainly in an individual form. Hence, I Want Better - mainly 
        because that is all I have real control of; self. All this represented by the official I Want Better 
        Campaign color: Metallic Gold. Acting as a residual reminder in an universally understood 
        language to urge us to be the best we can be. Go for Gold. #goforgold
    </p>

    <h2><span class="bold">INSPIRE CHANGE</span><br>A More Worthy Cause than Legislating it.</h2>

    <p>Currently one of the most all encompassing sentences this campaign contains and can be 
        contained in. Real change may not ever come from any other source. We’ve all been told
        from many different sources throughout the years that if you want change: start with your-
        self. Do. Others may watch. Others may learn &amp; see new possibilities attainable (all by the 
        simple personal pursuit of wanting better) more so essentially than what a rulebook / law /
        being told what to do can serve up.
    </p> 

    <h2>CREATIVITY <span class="bold">></span> <br>INNOVATION <span class="bold">></span> <br> YOU <span class="bold">></span> <br></h2>    

    <p>Our human history suggests that topic of abortion and our conduct with it is not the best / 
        most creative, innovative we can be. The subjects here are being called out by the IWBc
        menatility of needing its’ application. (+ many others, of course). There's a lot of 
        developments that need to occur. IWBc is the perfect basis for such. IWBc is the enabling 
        starting ground. The non-discrimitive nature of the IWBc’s engineering (personal liberal use) 
        will facilitate better.
    </p>

    <h2><span class="regular">THIS CAMPAIGN EXISTS TO BE:</span>
        The Structure &amp; Stability of the World’s 
        Efforts as we Work Step by Step in Solving 
        Our Need for Abortion. 
    </h2>

    <p>The individual application of the very simplistic mentality contained in the three words I Want
        Better facilitate the ability for us, even in all our differences to be together under a basic 
        umbrella’d mentality / campaign. What a radically good shift this’ll be. Imagine the collective 
        efforts of all humanity, now &amp; for generations to come working our way through the topic of 
        abortion.... 
    </p>

    <p>Starting first &amp; foremost with self &amp; perhaps that only. IWBc enables / allows any level of 
        commitment from it’s user. We see this played out in many of our other global issues but not
        with this cause. Instead, the user is asked all sorts of logistical questions and demanded to 
        need to want the same end / projected solution. This is devisive, ineffective and will
        truly never deliver absolute solution / us being our very best / going for the gold. The 
        abortion topic needs such freedom of use. #finally
    </p>  

    <h2><span class="regular">THIS IS A CAUSE</span>, NOT A DEBATE</h2>

    <p>There is a foaming at the mouth by some users when engaged on this topic. It is important 
        to understand this cause needs our love / our creativity and if at all possible our togetherness
        despite our differences. This is a cause, not a war against each other. #aCauseNotaWar 
    </p>

    <h2>THIS IS <span class="regular">NOT RELIGION</span></h2>

    <p>You do not have to religious to be a part of / use the I want Better campaign. Wanting better
        and or believing humanity is capable of more does not come with the mandate for you to call
        yourself of a world religion. All that said, whatever you call yourself - IWBc is for you. Want
        better anyway you see fit &amp; I’ll do the same. Hopefully there will be 7 Billion other users. 
        That’s change. #iLikeiWantBetter
    </p>

    <h2>THIS IS <span class="bold">NOT POLITICS</span>. THIS IS FOR YOU.</h2>

    <p>This cause is so wrongfully handicapped by the side vs side disposition of world politics, it is 
        very important for IWBc to break free of such a poor association / unhealthy entanglement.
        Allowing users the ability to deal with this topic in a newly sociably correct / effective &amp; 
        productive manner while inside the public arena of life will urge on a thriving of solutionable 
        steps.
    </p>

    <p>The I want Better campaign intends to this topic to back individual users. We need 
        empowerment, hope, residual identification &amp; inclusive collectivity if possible. #userfriendly
